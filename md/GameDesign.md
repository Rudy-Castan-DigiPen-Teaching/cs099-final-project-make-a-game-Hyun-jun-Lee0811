# High Concept
I thought I wanted to make a game of rescuing the princess from the devil. It's still hard for me to create a game of magic fighting devil. So I thought of a game that breaks the stage and rescues the princess.

# Theme
My game is about a warrior going to the rescue of a princess.

So the theme is "Devil's den". Because to rescue the princess, it have to go to her at various risk.
