# High Concept
I thought I wanted to make a game of rescuing the princess from the devil. It's still hard for me to create a game of magic fighting devil. So I thought of a game that breaks the stage and rescues the princess.

# Theme
My game is about a warrior going to the rescue of a princess.

So the theme is "Devil's den". Because to rescue the princess, it have to go to her at various risk.

You can see the devil's message by placing the mouse out of the screen or in the middle.

Of the three options, the real story is one.
